The national park which houses the falls is home to the Havasupai native american tribe, and is staying closed through June of 2022, despite a general outcry against this decision. Havasupai Falls was closed to tourists in order to protect the vulnerable people within the Havasupai tribe from the deadly threat of the imminent COVID-19 pandemic. Chairwoman of the Havasupai Tribe, Eva Kassoon, issued an official statement </span><span class="c0">&ldquo;In order to further protect the health and welfare of the Havasupai people and tribal residents, the Council finds it necessary to continue the suspension of its tourism operation until further notice.&rdquo; While the indigenous Americans who inhabit the area try to adjust to their new normal and to protect themselves from the virus, tourists that had booked and planned visits are outraged by the decision. They view the policy as bureaucratic and unnecessary.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For those who had booked, their options are as follows: they can reschedule their trip, or transfer their reservation to someone else only at the cost of a 10% transfer fee. Rescheduling can only be done online or by email, as the tribes have asked that no one call in regards to bookings. This system has been described as &ldquo;impractical for many travelers&rdquo; by major local news outlet azcentral. The statement echoes a sense of imperialistic entitlement that is all too familiar to native americans. A policy created for the protection of its people, is being attacked, for the simple reason that it slightly inconveniences the affluent people who want to use sacred lands for their own pleasure. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c8">What many tourists fail to understand is that not only are the tribe&#39;s people protecting themselves from the exposure, they are also protecting their land. Through the pandemic, visitation to national parks have skyrocketed, and with that so has littering and disregard for the natural environment. &nbsp;While white people and white culture have the history and reputation for raping ecosystems and pillaging other cultures, </span><span class="c4">&ldquo;Native Americans have long been regarded as ecosystem architects,&rdquo; according to Scientific American. The Havasupai national park has thrived under the watchful eyes and diligent hands of the Havasupai people. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Native Americans are constantly used and abused by white Americans. For example there is the case of Alberta Henry who is a member of the Navajo Nation and who operates a camping rental business outside of the Grand Canyon. For Time magazine she stated that &ldquo;a caucasian man from Tennessee came onto the reservation and told my nephews, &lsquo;Get those effing masks off! What&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rsquo; People are openly racist, even in front of my children.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c6"></span></p></body></html>
